# Reportcard-Generator
This programme generates report cards using OpenCV.

The student data and grades are fed into a csv file in the same order as the fields in the report card template.

Eg: [Name, Class,  English, Mathematics, Physical Education, Economics, Diligent, Responsible, Respectful, Attentive, Teacher's remarks]

The programme then saves the generated report card with the students' first name as the filename in pdf format.

The report card template:
